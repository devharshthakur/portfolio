   - Choose your fork and branch
   - Fill in the PR template with relevant details

3. **Code Review**:
   - Wait for review from maintainers
   - Make any requested changes

## üíª Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- [x] Avoid using `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- [x] Ensure the codebase remains type-safe
- [x] Use interfaces for object shapes
- [x] Use meaningful variable names

### React & Next.js

- [x] Follow functional component patterns
- [x] Use proper hooks for state management
- [x] Follow the Next.js routing conventions

### CSS

- [x] Use TailwindCSS classes appropriately
- [x] Follow the project's existing design patterns
- [x] Use responsive design principles

### üí¨ Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages. This helps with automated changelog generation and semantic versioning.

#### Commit Message Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Types

- `feat/` - A new feature
- `fix/` - A bug fix
- `perf/` - A performance improvement
- `chore/` - Changes to build process or auxiliary tools
- `docs/` - Documentation only changes
- `style/` - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
- `refactor/` - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test/` - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `ci/` - Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `build/` - Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies

#### Examples

```bash
# Feature
git commit -m "feat: add dark mode toggle component"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix: resolve navigation menu overflow issue"

# Performance improvement
git commit -m "perf: optimize image loading with lazy loading"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs: update README with new installation steps"

# Style changes

# Refactoring
git commit -m "refactor: extract reusable button component"

# Tests
git commit -m "test: add unit tests for contact form validation"

# Chores
git commit -m "chore: update dependencies to latest versions"
```

#### Guidelines

- [x] Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- [x] Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- [x] Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- [x] Reference issues and pull requests as appropriate
- [x] Use the appropriate type prefix for your changes
